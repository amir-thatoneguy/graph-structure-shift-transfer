# graph-structure-shift-transfer

This is an ongoing research project investigating transfer learning approaches for graph domain adaptation with structure shift. Stochastic block models create synthetic graphs with structure shift, and graph neural networks along with deep transfer approaches are then used for node classification on the resulting graphs. The code can be modified for new experiments without much change to the majority of the code.
