# graph-structure-shift-transfer

This repository holds the code for experiments and implementations of an ongoing research project, investigating transfer learning approaches for graph domain adaptation with structure shift. Stochastic block models create synthetic graphs with structure shift, and graph neural networks along with deep transfer approaches are then used for node classification on the resulting graphs.

# How to use
Run the jupyter notebook to reproduce the results or create new experiments.


# Project information
This research project is supervised by Dr. Gholamali Aminian at The Alan Turing Institute.
